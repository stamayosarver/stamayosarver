- 👋 Hi, I’m @stamayosarver, a student at Vanderbilt University aiming to major in BME and ECE with a minor in digital fabrication. I like learning about everything and live by the principle a wise man can learn much from a foolish question, where a fool can learn naught from a wise answer.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have an identical twin brother also going to Vanderbilt!
- 📐 I enjoy making small projects and seeing my PCBs come in the mail
- 🤖 I help make automated systems in Robotics club (ECE side)
- 💻 I like keeping up with latest AI news
